# MyReads Project

This is my final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.
The goal of this project is to give a full bookshelf for the users, with the status Reading, to read, and read.
Users can search books from our API clicking in the icon of add.

The solution is made in React, using some libraries like toastify for better User Expirience
## TL;DR

To execute theis project:

* clone this repository
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
